## Goal

In this project you will be exposed to a variety of practical and research issues related to IoT, 
AI related to macro photography. The goal is to create a budget friendly macro rail for image stacking so 
high resolution sharp macro images can be obtained. You will be designing the hardware and the software 
and test out the implemented solution. Another important goal of the project is that it should easily be reporducible 
by others and can be adapted to various mirorless or DSLR cameras.

We hope that the overall cost can be limited to below $100 which has to spend by you. The reason 
we want you to spend the money is so you are encouraged to provide a very cost effective solution.
Certainly if you already have hardware you can reuse it. Due to the portability, your board should 
support micropython or python. You should have a DSLR or mirorless camera. Macrotubes or a lens invert 
ring will be sufficient to get images.

## Tasks

* Identify the hardware and come up with a design that is reasonably budgetet. Discuss the need for a rail and which rail would be appropriate.
* Make sure code is all in python and hradware is accordingly selected. Manage the code in GitHub with me
* Select some samples such as insects and take test photos
* Develop an AI program that classifies the images based on features you take from the images you shoot or compare them agains a library of photo images from insects. 
* Alternatively use plant detection.
* Write a report about it and publish in an undergraduate publication venue
* Develop a poster presentation
* Showcase your cretion in the IU poster session

## Learning outcome

* Use python for IOT development
* Usa classificaton algorithms for image classificaion
* Get familiarized with researching, creating and presentation of a research product that is useful for citizen scientists or researchers to utilize it
